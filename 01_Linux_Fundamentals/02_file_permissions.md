# Beginner's Guide to Linux File Permissions

## Understanding Basic Permissions

Every file and directory in Linux has three types of permissions:

- **Read (r)**: View content
- **Write (w)**: Modify content
- **Execute (x)**: Run files or access directories

These permissions are set for three groups:

- **Owner (u)**: The user who owns the file
- **Group (g)**: Members of the file's group
- **Others (o)**: Everyone else

## Viewing Permissions

### ls -l

The most common way to view permissions:

```bash
$ ls -l myfile.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 john users 1024 Jan 5 10:00 myfile.txt
```

Let's break down what you see:

```
-rw-r--r--

 -: File type (- for file, d for directory)
 rw-: Others' permissions (r--)
 r--: Group's permissions (r--)
 r--: Owner's permissions (rw-)
```

## Essential Permission Commands

### 1. chmod (Change Mode)

Changes permissions of files and directories.

#### Using Numbers (Octal):

```bash
# Basic structure: chmod xyz file
# where x=owner, y=group, z=others
# 4=read, 2=write, 1=execute

# Common examples:
chmod 755 script.sh     # rwxr-xr-x (Common for scripts)
chmod 644 file.txt      # rw-r--r-- (Common for regular files)
chmod 777 file          # rwxrwxrwx (Full permissions - use carefully!)
```

#### Using Letters (Symbolic):

```bash
# Add permission
chmod +x script.sh      # Add execute permission for everyone
chmod u+w file.txt      # Add write permission for owner

# Remove permission
chmod -x script.sh      # Remove execute permission for everyone
chmod o-rw file.txt     # Remove read and write for others

# Set exact permissions
chmod u=rwx,go=rx file  # rwxr-xr-x
```

### 2. chown (Change Owner)

Changes the owner of files and directories.

```bash
# Basic usage
chown user file.txt              # Change owner
chown user:group file.txt        # Change owner and group
chown -R user:group directory/   # Change recursively for directory
```

### 3. chgrp (Change Group)

Changes the group of files and directories.

```bash
# Basic usage
chgrp developers file.txt        # Change group
chgrp -R developers project/     # Change group recursively
```

## Common Examples and Use Cases

### 1. Making a Script Executable

```bash
# Create a script
echo '#!/bin/bash' > script.sh
echo 'echo "Hello, World!"' >> script.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x script.sh

# Now you can run it
./script.sh
```

### 2. Setting Up a Shared Directory

```bash
# Create a directory for team collaboration
mkdir team_project
chmod 775 team_project     # rwxrwxr-x
chown :developers team_project
```

### 3. Protecting Sensitive Files

```bash
# Secure a file containing sensitive data
chmod 600 sensitive.txt    # rw-------
```

## Best Practices üåü

1. **Default File Permissions**

   - Regular files: 644 (rw-r--r--)
   - Scripts: 755 (rwxr-xr-x)
   - Sensitive files: 600 (rw-------)

2. **Directory Permissions**

   - Standard directories: 755 (rwxr-xr-x)
   - Private directories: 700 (rwx------)
   - Shared directories: 775 (rwxrwxr-x)

3. **Safety Tips**
   - Avoid using 777 (full permissions for everyone)
   - Be careful with recursive changes (-R)
   - Double-check before changing system files
   - Make backups before major permission changes

## Quick Permission Reference üìù

```
Permissions  Octal   Use Case
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
rwx------    700     Private directories
rwxr-xr-x    755     Scripts, executables, public directories
rw-------    600     Sensitive files
rw-r--r--    644     Regular files (documents, images)
rwxrwxr-x    775     Shared directories for group collaboration
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Can't execute a script?**

   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```

2. **Permission denied when accessing a file?**

   ```bash
   # Check current permissions
   ls -l file.txt

   # Add read permission
   chmod +r file.txt
   ```

3. **Need to change ownership of files copied from elsewhere?**
   ```bash
   chown -R $USER:$USER directory/
   ```

Remember: With great power comes great responsibility! Always be careful when changing permissions, especially with system files or when using sudo.
