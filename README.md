# Bash and Linux Journey

This project started as my journey to learn Linux and Bash scripting as part of a university module.

Along the way, I realized how valuable this knowledge could be, so I decided to enhance it and share it with everyone.

This guide serves as a solid starting point for anyone looking to understand Linux fundamentals and dive into Bash scripting.
