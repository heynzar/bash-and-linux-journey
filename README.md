# üêß Bash and Linux Journey

This project started as my journey to learn Linux and Bash scripting as part of a university module.

Along the way, I realized how valuable this knowledge could be, so I decided to enhance it and share it with everyone.

This guide serves as a solid starting point for anyone looking to understand Linux fundamentals and dive into Bash scripting.

## 2.1 Introduction To Bash Scripts

**Core Concepts**

A Bash script is a text file containing a sequence of shell commands for automated execution. Think of it as a recipe for your computer to follow.

**Essential Components**

1. **Shebang Line**

   - Every script starts with `#!/bin/bash`
   - Must be the first line of the file

2. **Basic Script Creation Process**
   ```bash
   nano script_name.sh    # Create/edit script
   chmod +x script_name.sh # Make executable
   ./script_name.sh       # Run script
   ```

**Best Practices**

- Include clear comments explaining the script's purpose
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `backup_photos.sh` instead of `script1.sh`)
- Avoid spaces around equal signs in assignments (`name="John"`, not `name = "John"`)

**Script Structure Example**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script purpose
# Author
# Date

# Main commands
command1
command2

# End of script notification
```

For detailed examples and practices, explore the full guide [`01_Introduction_Bash_Scripts.md`](https://github.com/heynzar/bash-and-linux-journey/blob/main/02_Bash_Fundamentals/01_Introduction_Bash_Scripts.md).

## 2.2 Variables

Variables are placeholders for storing data in Bash scripts.

**Key takeaways:**

- Assign values with `=` (no spaces).
- Use meaningful names (e.g., `user_name` not `a`).
- Access values with `$`, like `$name`.

**Types include:**

- **Shell Variables:** Script-local variables.
- **Environment Variables:** System-wide variables like `$HOME` and `$USER`.

To capture user input, use `read`, optionally with prompts or timeouts. Combine these with command substitution to store output from commands like `date`.

For detailed examples and practices, explore the full guide [`02_Variables.md`](https://github.com/heynzar/bash-and-linux-journey/blob/main/02_Bash_Fundamentals/02_Variables.md).

## 2.3 Special Variables

**Special Variables Overview**

Key shell variables and their purposes:

- `$0` - Script name
- `$1` to `$9` - Script arguments (positional parameters)
- `$#` - Number of arguments
- `$*` and `$@` - All arguments
- `$?` - Last command's exit status
- `$$` - Current process ID
- `$!` - Last background process ID

**Parameter Handling**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
name=${1:-"Default"}    # Default value if parameter is unset
length=${#1}            # Parameter length
substring=${1:0:3}      # Extract substring
```

**Best Practices**

- Quote variables when using them: `"$variable"`
- Check required arguments:

```bash
if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 arg1 arg2"
    exit 1
fi
```

- Use meaningful variable names
- Provide default values for optional parameters

For detailed examples and practices, explore the full guide [`03_Special_variables.md`](https://github.com/heynzar/bash-and-linux-journey/blob/main/02_Bash_Fundamentals/03_Special_variables.md).

## 2.4 Control Flow

### 1. If Statements

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # code
elif [ condition ]; then
    # code
else
    # code
fi
```

### 2. Case Statements

```bash
case $variable in
    pattern1) commands ;;
    pattern2) commands ;;
    *) default commands ;;
esac
```

### Condition Types

1. **Numeric Comparisons**

   - `-eq` - Equal to
   - `-ne` - Not equal
   - `-gt` - Greater than
   - `-lt` - Less than
   - `-ge` - Greater than or equal
   - `-le` - Less than or equal

2. **String Tests**

   - `=` - Equal to
   - `!=` - Not equal to
   - `-z` - Empty string
   - `-n` - Non-empty string

3. **File Tests**
   - `-e` - Exists
   - `-f` - Regular file
   - `-d` - Directory
   - `-r` - Readable
   - `-w` - Writable
   - `-x` - Executable

For detailed examples and practices, explore the full guide [`04_Control_Flow.md`](https://github.com/heynzar/bash-and-linux-journey/blob/main/02_Bash_Fundamentals/04_Control_Flow.md).

## 2.5 Numbers and Strings

### Arithmetic Operations

1. **Using let**

```bash
let sum=5+3
let product=4*3
```

1. **Using expr**

```bash
result=$(expr 10 + 5)
product=$(expr 5 \* 3)
```

1. **Double Parentheses**

```bash
sum=$((5 + 3))
power=$((2 ** 3))  # Exponentiation
```

### String Operations

**Basic String Manipulation**

- Length: `${#string}`
- Concatenation: `full_name="$first $last"`
- Substring: `${string:start:length}`
- Uppercase: `${string^^}`
- Lowercase: `${string,,}`

For detailed examples and practices, explore the full guide [`05_Numbers_and_Strings.md`](https://github.com/heynzar/bash-and-linux-journey/blob/main/02_Bash_Fundamentals/05_Numbers_and_Strings.md).

## 2.6 Loops and Iteration

### Loop Types

**1. For Loops**

```bash
# Basic syntax
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
    echo "$i"
done

# Range syntax
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "$i"
done

# C-style syntax
for ((i=1; i<=5; i++)); do
    echo "$i"
done
```

**2. While Loops**

```bash
# Basic while
counter=1
while [ $counter -le 5 ]; do
    ((counter++))
done

# Reading files
while read -r line; do
    echo "$line"
done < file.txt
```

### Control Statements

- `break` - Exit the loop
- `continue` - Skip to next iteration

For detailed examples and practices, explore the full guide [`06_Loops_and_Iteration.md`](https://github.com/heynzar/bash-and-linux-journey/blob/main/02_Bash_Fundamentals/06_Loops_and_Iteration.md).

## 2.7 Functions

### 1. Basic Function Structure

- Define a function using:
  ```bash
  function_name() {
      # Function code
  }
  ```
- Call the function by its name.

### 2. Functions with Parameters

- Access parameters using `$1`, `$2`, etc.
- Use `$@` to loop through all parameters.

### 3. Return Values

- Use `return` for exit codes (success: `0`, failure: non-zero).
- Use `echo` to output values for further processing.

### 4. Local Variables

- Use `local` keyword to restrict variable scope within functions.

For detailed examples and practices, explore the full guide [`07_Functions.md`](https://github.com/heynzar/bash-and-linux-journey/blob/main/02_Bash_Fundamentals/07_Functions.md).
