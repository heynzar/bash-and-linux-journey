# Bash and Linux Journey

This project started as my journey to learn Linux and Bash scripting as part of a university module.

Along the way, I realized how valuable this knowledge could be, so I decided to enhance it and share it with everyone.

This guide serves as a solid starting point for anyone looking to understand Linux fundamentals and dive into Bash scripting.

## 2.2 Variables

Variables are placeholders for storing data in Bash scripts.

**Key takeaways:**

- Assign values with `=` (no spaces).
- Use meaningful names (e.g., `user_name` not `a`).
- Access values with `$`, like `$name`.

**Types include:**

- **Shell Variables:** Script-local variables.
- **Environment Variables:** System-wide variables like `$HOME` and `$USER`.

To capture user input, use `read`, optionally with prompts or timeouts. Combine these with command substitution to store output from commands like `date`.

For detailed examples and practices, explore the full guide [`02_Variables.md`](#).
